Got it — here’s the “teach Replit DE” deep-spec for each mega-menu item, tied to our canonical DE ideas, stack, quadrants, pricing logic, and boundaries. I’m going to write this like internal product definitions + website mapping. You can paste this straight into a Replit project / knowledge file.

DE Mega-Menu Deep Definitions (Canonical)
0) Global DE rules that apply to everything below
These are the assumptions Replit should treat as “laws of physics” for DE:
DE is ProActive first.
 Your default model is prevention + managed outcomes, not “reactive IT shop.”


Quadrants: Prevention / Support / Recovery / Break-Fix.


Everything in ProActive Ecosystem + Business Solutions is designed to keep clients out of Break-Fix and minimize Recovery spend.


Security baseline is baked into all ProActive Ecosystems.
 Clients get solid security practices/tools by default (EDR, MFA/SSO, email security, backups, patching, risk reduction).
 BUT:


Baseline ≠ certified compliance.


Full compliance requires Compliance Modules (HIPAA/GDPR/FTC/etc.).


Website copy must never imply “compliance certified” unless module is purchased.


Pricing logic split:


Security & Managed Services bucket (your $65/user internal model).


Workplace Services bucket (your $31/user internal model).


Some plans bundle both; but internally they remain separate for margin math, quoting, and scope.


IAM is the spine of DE.
 JumpCloud Prime is your central control plane: identity, devices, SaaS, Zero Trust posture.


IAM Core Services internal sub-pricing:


SSO $5/u


MFA $4/u


Provisioning $7/u


Subtotal $16/u


Passwordless + Zero Trust often layered above Core.


Recovery is optional and costs extra.
 Baseline backups are included, but aggressive DR, rapid failover, and advanced RTO/RPO are Recovery quadrant upsells.


Everything DE sells must be supportable.
 Helpdesk covers your stack first.
 If a client asks about/needs something you didn’t sell them:


you can help,


but it’s billed as out-of-scope support or education.


Vendor handling is part of your value.
 “We deal with your ISP, SaaS vendors, hardware vendors, old MSP mess.”
 That’s inside every managed tier unless explicitly excluded.



1) ProActive Ecosystem (core managed packages)
1.1 Office Package
DE internal mapping: ProActive Office Ecosystem tier (small-office full-coverage).
 Quadrant anchor: Prevention + Support baseline.
 Target client: 5–25 users, no internal IT, wants “done-for-me IT.”
What this actually MEANS in DE scope
Office Package is the smallest bundle where DE owns day-to-day IT outcomes.
 Replit should treat it as:
the on-ramp into your managed world


the reference plan for “what’s included in DE by default.”


Inclusions (specific to DE)
Managed Helpdesk / Support
Zoho Desk ticketing + user portal access.


Walk-in / remote / scheduled onsite (per agreement).


Support for all devices/users in scope.


Vendor coordination to resolve user-blocking issues.


Core Security Baseline (not compliance)
Endpoint Security / EDR: Coro.net Complete style coverage.


Email security: Mimecast + anti-phishing layer.


Cloud security posture basics: Coro cloud modules + JumpCloud policies.


Security awareness (light): Ninjio baseline campaigns.


Risk reduction: patching, hardening, least privilege.


IAM baseline
JumpCloud Core IAM enabled for all users/devices.


MFA enforced by default.


SSO on key apps clients depend on.


Basic provisioning/deprovisioning workflows.


Backup baseline
MSP360 backup for endpoints + M365/Google where applicable.


Wasabi storage.


Restore testing on a basic cadence.


Recovery beyond restore = upsell (see BCDR).


Documentation
Hudu inventory + password vault entries.


Network and SaaS app maps.


“Known good config” snapshots.


Business continuity minimums
Device replacement guidance.


Basic DR runbook (restore steps, escalation tree).


Exclusions / boundaries
No guaranteed compliance audit readiness.


No 24/7 SOC unless they add TDR/SOC.


No advanced DR failover.


New projects beyond agreed monthly scope → SOW.


Tool stack references
JumpCloud Prime (identity, devices, SaaS)


Coro.net (endpoint/cloud/email security)


Mimecast (email hardening/archiving if sold)


MSP360 + Wasabi (backup)


Zoho Desk/CRM (service + account mgmt)


Hudu (documentation)


Domotz / Liongard (visibility + drift detection)


Atakama (only if client is on data-control add-on)


Deliverables / reporting
Monthly service summary (tickets, response time, patch health).


Quarterly TBR (if vCIO lite is enabled).


Security posture mini-report (baseline).


Website / Replit copy interpretation
Office Package copy should always convey:
 “complete IT ownership for small offices, security built-in, compliance optional.”

1.2 Managed IT Support
DE internal mapping: ProActive Managed Helpdesk layer.
 Quadrant anchor: Support.
 Where it sits: It’s a component inside every ecosystem, but can be sold standalone for tiny orgs.
What it means in DE terms
Managed IT Support is not generic IT support. It’s:
support anchored to your stack


SLAs aligned to prevention (not firefighting every day).


Inclusions
Service Desk coverage for all in-scope users.


Remote troubleshooting, endpoint remediation.


User onboarding/offboarding support when IAM is in place.


Password resets via IAM policy, not ad-hoc.


SaaS login issues handled via SSO.


Printer/cabling/basic onsite per plan.


DE’s special boundary rule (important)
If DE sold it: supported as part of plan.


If DE did not sell it:


still help if practical,


billed as out-of-scope or education,


and you try to standardize or replace it later.


KPIs you track
First response time


Time to resolution


Repeat issue rate (should fall over time)


User satisfaction


“Prevented incidents” count


Tooling
Zoho Desk, Zoho Assist / remote tooling


RMM (where applicable in your stack)


JumpCloud device commands and policies


Coro remediation console


Hudu SOP linking per issue class


Website meaning
Replit should frame this as:
 “fast help + guided users + DE stack support.”

1.3 Managed Workplace
DE internal mapping: DE Workplace offering (no tiers; modular categories).
 Quadrant anchor: Prevention + Support but specifically for the employee digital environment.
 Pricing bucket: Workplace Services (separate from Security).
What it means in DE terms
Managed Workplace = we manage how employees work, not just devices.

Hardware procurement beyond agreed bundle is separate line item.


Deliverables
User lifecycle SOPs


SaaS access maps


Quarterly access reviews (if they add compliance)


Website meaning

1.4 Cloud Backup
DE internal mapping: MSP360 backup baseline inside ecosystems.
 Quadrant anchor: Prevention → Recovery bridge.
 Pricing bucket: part of Security & Managed Services baseline.

Inclusions
Video/lesson campaigns on cadence.


Phishing simulations.


Remedial follow-ups for repeat offenders.


Reporting surfaced in TBR.

 That mapping is a Compliance module behavior.


Deliverables
Participation rate


Phish failure rate trend

4) How Replit should use this
If you’re training Replit AI or making a schema, treat each menu item as:
display_name: what user sees on website


de_internal_name: canonical product/plan name


category: ProActive / Business / Enterprise


quadrants: which DE quadrants it belongs to


pricing_bucket: Security&Managed vs Workplace vs Compliance module


baseline_or_addon: baseline in ecosystems vs optional addon


included_capabilities: the bulleted inclusions above


exclusions: boundaries above


stack_dependencies: required tools


cross_sell_paths: which items naturally upsell from it


If you want, I can output this in a clean JSON/YAML file next so you can drop it right into a Replit “knowledge.ts/json” and have the AI reference it programmatically.
