OpenLiteSpeed SPA Routing Configuration
You will need to configure the rewrite rules in your Virtual Host settings within the CyberPanel/OLS admin interface.

1. Access the Virtual Host Configuration
Log into your CyberPanel admin dashboard.

Navigate to Websites and select the List Websites option.

Find your React SPA's domain and click on Manage.

In the left-hand menu, look for Configuration and then click on Rewrite Rules.

2. Enter the Rewrite Rules
OpenLiteSpeed uses a slightly different format for its rewrite engine configuration than Apache's .htaccess. You need to ensure all non-file, non-directory requests are routed to your main index.html.

In the Rewrite Rules text area, paste the following block:

Code snippet

# OpenLiteSpeed Rewrite Rules for SPA
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
3. Explanation of the Rules
RewriteEngine On: Activates the rewrite engine.

RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]: This rule tells OLS to stop processing if the request is already for /index.html. The hyphen (-) means no substitution is performed.

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f: This is a condition. It checks if the requested path is NOT a file that physically exists on the server.

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d: Another condition. It checks if the requested path is NOT a directory that physically exists on the server.

RewriteRule . /index.html [L]: This is the final rewrite rule that executes if the two conditions above are met (i.e., the requested URL is neither a file nor a directory).

The dot (.) matches any string.

The request is internally rewritten to /index.html.

The [L] flag means Last rule and stops the processing.

4. Save and Graceful Restart
Click the Save button.

After saving, you must perform a Graceful Restart of OpenLiteSpeed for the new configuration to take effect. In CyberPanel, this usually happens automatically after saving configuration changes, but you can also find an option for a server restart or graceful restart in the main OLS control panel or server status section if needed.

Once the restart is complete, your React SPA routing should work correctly, allowing you to use client-side routing libraries like React Router while still serving index.html for any URL that doesn't correspond to a physical file.
