Yep — with OpenLiteSpeed (via CyberPanel), SPA routing works, but only if the rewrite is being applied at the right level and in the right folder. Here are the two reliable ways to do it. Pick one.

First: confirm docRoot and where index.html lives

OpenLiteSpeed will only rewrite to an index.html that exists inside docRoot.

So docRoot should be the folder that contains your built index.html.

Example, if your build output is:

/home/digeratiexperts.com/public_html/dist/public/index.html


then set docRoot to:

$VH_ROOT/public_html/dist/public


CyberPanel path:
Websites → List Websites → Manage → vHost Conf → docRoot

Save.

Option A (recommended): do rewrite in vHost Conf (no .htaccess needed)

CyberPanel:
Websites → List Websites → Manage → vHost Conf

Find your rewrite { ... } block and make it like this:

rewrite  {
  enable                  1
  autoLoadHtaccess        0

  rewriteRules  {
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/\.well-known/
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.html [L,QSA]
  }
}


What this does:

If the request is not a real file or folder, it serves /index.html

Your React Router takes over from there.

Then:
CyberPanel → Restart LiteSpeed (or terminal sudo systemctl restart lsws)
and flush LSCache if enabled.

Option B: keep .htaccess, but make OpenLiteSpeed actually read it

OLS does support .htaccess, but only when:

Rewrite is enabled and htaccess autoload is on:

rewrite  {
  enable 1
  autoLoadHtaccess 1
}


Your .htaccess is in the actual docRoot, not in /client or elsewhere.

So if docRoot =
/home/digeratiexperts.com/public_html/dist/public

then .htaccess must be:
/home/digeratiexperts.com/public_html/dist/public/.htaccess

Contents:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]


File permissions allow reading:

chown digerXXXX:digerXXXX /home/digeratiexperts.com/public_html/dist/public/.htaccess
chmod 644 /home/digeratiexperts.com/public_html/dist/public/.htaccess


Restart LSWS + flush cache.

If your app is served under a subpath

Example: site is at https://digeratiexperts.com/portal/...

Then change to:

vHost rewriteRules:

RewriteBase /portal/
RewriteRule ^portal/(.*)$ /portal/index.html [L,QSA]


.htaccess:

RewriteBase /portal/
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /portal/index.html [L]

Quick sanity check after you apply

Run:

ls -la /home/digeratiexperts.com/public_html/dist/public/index.html
