Yes! On **CyberPanel with OpenLiteSpeed, .htaccess is completely ignored by default because OpenLiteSpeed does not parse Apache .htaccess files (unless you explicitly enable the compatibility module, which is slow and not recommended).
You need to configure the rewrite rules directly in the OpenLiteSpeed vHost or context settings for your domain.
Here are the 3 best ways to make a React (or any) SPA work perfectly on CyberPanel + OpenLiteSpeed:
Method 1 – Recommended: Use the “React/Angular/Vue” template in CyberPanel (easiest)

Log into CyberPanel → Websites → List Websites → Manage for your domain
Click Rewrite Rules tab
Choose the preset dropdown at the top → select React Router or Vue/Angular SPA
Click Save Rewrite Rules

That’s it! CyberPanel will automatically add the correct OpenLiteSpeed rewrite rules for you.
If the preset is missing or you want to do it manually, use one of the methods below.
Method 2 – Manual rewrite rules in CyberPanel (works 100%)
Go to the same place:
CyberPanel → Websites → List Websites → Manage → Rewrite Rules
Paste exactly these rules and save:
confRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^ - [L]

RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]
This is the standard React Router rule translated for OpenLiteSpeed syntax.
Method 3 – Add a Static Context (alternative, also very clean)
Instead of rewrite rules, you can create a dedicated context:

In the same Manage screen → Contexts tab → Create Context
Type: Static
URI: /
Location: /home/yourdomain.com/public_html (or wherever your React build folder is)
Enable Enable Rewrite
In the Rewrite Rules box inside the context, put:

confRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^.*$ /index.html [L]

Save and graceful restart (CyberPanel usually does it automatically).

Bonus: If you built React with basename or are using a subfolder
If your app is in a subfolder like https://example.com/myapp/, change the rules to:
confRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^ - [L]

RewriteRule ^myapp/(.*)$ /myapp/index.html [L]
Or adjust the context URI to /myapp/ accordingly.
Verify it works
After applying any of the above, test by directly visiting:
texthttps://yourdomain.com/some-random-path-that-doesnt-exist
You should see your React app load (and the browser URL stay the same) instead of a 404.
That’s all you need — no .htaccess required! Let me know if you’re still getting 404s and I’ll help debug your exact setup.
