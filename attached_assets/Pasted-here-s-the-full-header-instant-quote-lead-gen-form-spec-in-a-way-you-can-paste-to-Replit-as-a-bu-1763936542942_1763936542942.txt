here’s the full “header instant-quote / lead-gen” form spec in a way you can paste to Replit as a build blueprint. I’m going to spell out the UX, steps, logic, fields, validation, tracking, and success states so it’s perfect for lead generation while still feeling lightweight in the header.

DE Header Instant-Quote Form (Multi-Step Lead Gen Wizard)
Purpose

A friction-low, header/hero embedded multi-step form that:

Personalizes a quick “best plan” recommendation.

Captures high-quality leads without feeling like a long form.

Routes data into your CRM + triggers follow-up automations.

Placement / Trigger

Lives in the hero/header as a compact widget.

Starts as a small inline card with a CTA button:
Button text: “Get Instant Plan Match”

On click, it expands inline or opens a modal drawer (preferred on mobile).

Step Count

3 screens total (2 decision steps + final lead capture).

Step 1 — Seat Sizing (Header Screen)

Goal: Capture company size fast + segment pricing path.

UI elements:

Slider: “How many users?”

Range: 1–100

Default: 10

Shows live number bubble above slider.

Helper text under slider:
“Includes employees and shared devices.”

Toggle: “More than 100 users?”

Options: Yes / No

If “Yes”:

Slider disables or fades out.

Show micro-message:
“No problem — we’ll tailor enterprise sizing.”

Buttons:

Primary: “Next”

Secondary small text link: “Skip and talk to us” (routes to contact)

Validation:

Slider must be ≥1 unless toggle “Yes”.

If slider left blank (shouldn’t happen), auto-set to 10.

Event tracking:

Track step1_view, step1_next_click, seats selected, toggle state.

Step 2 — Needs Snapshot (Screen 2)

Goal: Identify infrastructure + device needs so plan match is credible.

UI elements (2 dropdowns):

Dropdown A:

Label:
“Do you need office internet, secure connectivity, wireless, and cloud storage?”

Options: Yes / No / Not sure

Dropdown B:

Label:
“Do you need desktops and laptops included or managed?”

Options: Yes / No / Not sure

Optional tiny helper row (non-blocking):

“Not sure? Choose ‘Not sure’ — we’ll guide you.”

Buttons:

Primary: “See My Best Plan”

Secondary: “Back”

Validation:

Both dropdowns required (but allow “Not sure”).

Event tracking:

step2_view, step2_submit, answers.

Step 3 — Lead Capture + Result (Screen 3)

Goal: Show recommendation headline only after capturing contact (classic high-conversion gate).

Top copy block:

Bold header: “Show Me The Best Plan!”

Body text:
“In order for us to know if our Productivity, Connectivity or Techtility Plan is the best for you, we’ll need to know who we are quoting.”

Fields (top 4 contact fields):

Email (required)

Label: “Please enter your email*”

Placeholder: “Please show me my instant quote.”

First Name (required)

Last Name (required)

Company Name (required)

Security / Spam defense:

Invisible honeypot field (hidden input).

reCAPTCHA-style alternative if wanted later, but start with honeypot.

Basic rate limiting per IP (e.g., 3 submits / 10 min).

Consent checkbox (recommended for lead quality):

Checkbox label:
“I agree to be contacted about my plan match.”

Required for submit.

Buttons:

Primary: “Get My Instant Match”

Secondary: “Back”

Validation rules:

Email must be valid format.

Names min 2 chars.

Company min 2 chars.

Consent required.

Honeypot must be empty.

On submit:

Show a short “calculating…” state (0.8–1.2s).

Then show results panel:

Results panel (client-facing wording, no vendors):

Headline: “Your Best Fit Plan:”

Plan name determined by logic below.

3 bullet “why this fits you” based on their answers.

CTA button: “Schedule a 15-min Fit Call”

Secondary CTA: “Email me the details” (auto-checked)

Event tracking:

step3_view, lead_submit, lead_success, fit_call_click.

Plan Match Logic (Simple + Explainable)

Use this lightweight rule engine to pick a plan label.

Inputs:

seats (number or “enterprise”)

needs_connectivity (Yes/No/NotSure)

needs_devices (Yes/No/NotSure)

Rules:

If toggle “More than 100 users?” = Yes
→ Enterprise Fit (route to human follow-up)

Else if needs_connectivity = Yes AND needs_devices = Yes
→ Techtility Plan (all-in ecosystem)

Else if needs_connectivity = Yes AND needs_devices != Yes
→ Connectivity Plan (network + cloud focus)

Else if needs_connectivity != Yes AND needs_devices = Yes
→ Productivity Plan (end-user + device focus)

Else
→ Productivity Plan (default smallest on-ramp)

Output structure:

recommended_plan

reason_bullets[] (derived from rules)

next_step_cta
