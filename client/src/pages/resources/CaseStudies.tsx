      challenge: "A 25-employee medical practice in Phoenix failed their annual security audit. Patient records were stored on an aging on-premises server with no encryption, staff used personal email for appointment reminders, and there was no documented incident response plan. They faced potential fines exceeding $50,000 and risked losing their ability to accept insurance.",
      solution: "Deployed our ProActive Business tier with HIPAA-specific controls: encrypted Microsoft 365 email with DLP policies, secure SharePoint document management with role-based access, endpoint detection on all workstations, encrypted backup with 15-minute RPO, and a full HIPAA Security Risk Assessment. We provided staff training and created their required policies and procedures documentation.",

      challenge: "A 50-attorney firm in Scottsdale was hit by ransomware that encrypted their entire file server, including 15 years of case files. Their previous IT provider had no backup verification process, and the last good backup was 3 weeks old. The firm lost $180,000 in billable hours during the week-long recovery and faced malpractice exposure from missed court deadlines.",
      solution: "After emergency incident response and data recovery, we implemented our ProActive Enterprise package: 24/7 SOC monitoring, advanced EDR with automated threat containment, immutable cloud backups with 15-minute RPOs, network segmentation isolating their document management system, and privileged access management for all administrative accounts. We also deployed DNS-layer security and a security awareness training program.",

The insurer required MFA on all accounts, EDR on every endpoint, a documented incident response plan, and proof of employee security training. Their break-fix IT provider could not meet these requirements, and the firm risked losing coverage entirely during tax season.",
      solution: "Deployed our ProActive Office tier with insurance compliance focus: MFA across all Microsoft 365 and accounting applications, managed EDR with 24/7 monitoring, documented incident response and business continuity plans, quarterly security awareness training with phishing simulations, and encrypted backup of their tax preparation environment. We provided the insurer with a detailed controls attestation letter.",

A malware infection on an office workstation spread to their production floor, shutting down 3 CNC machines for 2 days and costing $95,000 in lost production. Their IT was managed by the owner's nephew who worked part-time.",
      solution: "Implemented a co-managed IT approach with proper network architecture: segmented the network into production, office, and guest VLANs with next-gen firewall policies between them. Deployed managed switches, enterprise Wi-Fi, endpoint protection on all office machines, and an industrial-grade backup solution for their ERP database. Set up real-time monitoring with alerts for any cross-segment traffic anomalies.",

The firm's email was hosted on an unmanaged server with no MFA, no email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), and agents were using personal devices without any security controls.",
      solution: "Migrated to Microsoft 365 with advanced threat protection: configured DMARC/DKIM/SPF to prevent email spoofing, deployed conditional access policies, MFA for all users, and managed mobile device enrollment for agents. Implemented a wire fraud prevention protocol with out-of-band verification procedures and trained all agents on BEC recognition.",
