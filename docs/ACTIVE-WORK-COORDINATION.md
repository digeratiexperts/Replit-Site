# DE Active Work Coordination

Status: **MANDATORY companion** to `docs/AI-ENGINEERING-GOVERNANCE.md`.

## Why this exists

A claim committed only on an unmerged feature branch is invisible to agents that correctly inspect `origin/main`. On August 30, 2026, `.ai/ACTIVE_WORK.yaml` on `main` showed no claims while a substantial homepage/Ask DE implementation PR was still open. That proved the YAML file cannot be the sole concurrency lock.

## Authoritative lock order

Before editing code, every agent must inspect, in this order:

1. **Open GitHub issues** marked or titled `ACTIVE`, `P0`, `IN PROGRESS`, recovery, or otherwise clearly describing current implementation ownership.
2. **All open pull requests**, including changed files, head branch, base branch, and current mergeability.
3. **Relevant remote branches** when a prior task/recovery branch is named.
4. `.ai/ACTIVE_WORK.yaml` as a convenient mirror.
5. `docs/SITE-VISUAL-TASKS.md` for visual work.

GitHub-visible issues and PRs are authoritative because every agent can see them without first merging another agent's branch.

## Starting work

Create or update one GitHub issue before implementation. Record:

- task id/title;
- owner/integrator;
- subsystem;
- branch;
- exact starting `origin/main` SHA;
- expected files or globs;
- dependencies/source PRs;
- status;
- explicit blockers.

Then create an isolated branch/worktree. A YAML claim may mirror the issue, but the issue must exist first.

## Collision rule

If an open issue/PR overlaps the same component, route, subsystem, or expected files:

- do not start a parallel rewrite;
- link the existing work;
- reconcile through the lead integrator;
- preserve unique commits before closing/superseding anything.

An empty YAML registry never means the repository is idle.

## Local-only WIP

Local-only code is an emergency preservation condition. Before continuing development:

1. inspect uncommitted changes, local commits, stash, worktrees, and agent artifacts;
2. commit recoverable work intact to a `recovery/*` branch before refactoring;
3. create a GitHub recovery issue containing the original task, source environment, last known remote SHA, and recovery status;
4. if the local state cannot be recovered, mark the implementation lost but keep the requirement tracked for rebuild.

Never silently drop local WIP because another PR shipped around it.

## Before merge

Immediately before merge, repeat the GitHub issue/PR/branch audit and fetch latest `main`. If `main` moved after validation began, the branch must be reconciled and the applicable gates rerun. A previously green run does not cover commits that landed afterward.

## Completion

A task is released only when its actual status is recorded as one of:

- `MERGED`
- `VERIFIED LIVE`
- `BLOCKED`
- `ABANDONED`
- `SUPERSEDED`
- `LOST LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION — REQUIREMENT PRESERVED`

Close the active GitHub issue/claim only when the state above is explicit and no recovery work remains.
